          <div class="body-text">As the Purchasing Specialist for the Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) Department at the University of Minnesota, I managed our department's purchasing and supply orders.  
		The University used an online purchasing system for internal orders called U Market.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The U Market interface was a bit daunting to new users, so I wrote a user guide for the student employees who monitored our supply levels. 
		This guide showed them how to place an order and assign it to me to finish processing the purchase.</div>

          <div class="body-text">This document went through several iterations before the final redesign linked on this page. 
	  	I adapted a previous draft of the document when I created this guide, updating the text and adding sections to explain sub-processes such as ordering from Amazon through U Market.</div>
          <div class="body-text">As I reworked the guide, I made it more readable and user-friendly. 
		  I updated the formatting of the document to look professional and consistent with other department documentation I helped create. 
		  In addition, I added screenshots of the U Market interface to the guide to explain certain steps.
