          <div class="body-text">When I worked at the University of Minnesota, I served as the payroll contact for the Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) Department.  
		In that role, one of my responsibilities was ensuring that all new hires completed their required onboarding paperwork.</div>
          <div class="body-text">As part of the onboarding process, the University of Minnesota required that all new employees provided proof of COVID vaccination or requested an exemption. 
		The instructions on how to complete this requirement were separated across several different University web pages, so I decided to create a how-to guide that would consolidate all of the necessary information for new employees in my department.</div>

          <div class="body-text">I created this document from scratch, and I began by researching the information on the vaccination requirements listed across the different University web pages.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Once I had consolidated all of the information I needed, I worked on rewriting the instructions to address the user directly. I also included screenshots of the online interface for new hires to follow along.
