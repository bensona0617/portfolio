		The preliminary exam a thesis proposal, both written and oral.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">When I began redesigning the exam guide, I first met with students who had recently taken their preliminary exams to ask them about how they used (or didn't use) the guide.
		I received feedback from these students about what was helpful in the document and what had confused them as they prepared for the exam.
		I collaborated with other stakeholders on the project as well, including faculty advisors involved in the exam process.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Finally, I used the design principles of alignment, contrast, proximity, and repetition to create a visually appealing and well-organized final product.
